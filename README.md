# Count Von Embedding
This is a submission for a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge)
as well as my first PyTorch project. We used transfer learning with BERT to create the simplest possible submission.
Inference is performed in a Kaggle kernel. We achieved acceptable generalization error compared to the trained model.
